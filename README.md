Social media platforms use short, highly engaging videos to catch users' attention. While the short-form video feeds popularized by TikTok are rapidly spreading to other platforms, we do not yet understand their impact on cognitive functions. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=60) investigating the impact of engaging with TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube while performing a Prospective Memory task (i.e., executing a previously planned action). The study required participants to remember intentions over interruptions. We found that the TikTok condition significantly degraded the users’ performance in this task. As none of the other conditions (Twitter, YouTube, no activity) had a similar effect, our results indicate that the combination of short videos and rapid context-switching impairs intention recall and execution. We contribute a quantified understanding of the effect of social media feed format on Prospective Memory and outline consequences for media technology designers to not harm the users’ memory and wellbeing.

## Full Paper

The paper is available in [chiossi2023short.pdf](./chiossi2023short.pdf).

## Data frame

- The [./data/rt.csv](./data/rt.csv) provides the data frame of reaction times.
- The [./data/acc.csv](./data/acc.csv) provides the data frame of reaction accuracy scores.
- The [./data/q.csv](./data/q.csv) provides the data frame collected from questionnaires.
- The [./data/ddm.csv](./data/ddm.csv) is the learned DDM features using [./appendix2_ddm_fitting.ipynb](./appendix2_ddm_fitting.ipynb), which is then used in [./3.ddm_anova.ipynb](./3.ddm_anova.ipynb).

## Figures

All figures appeared in the paper are placed in [./figures](./figures) and can be reproduced using `*_vis.ipynb` files.

## Analysis

The included Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis reproduces the entire Section 4 of the paper:

- [1.1.response_accuracy.ipynb](./1.1.response_accuracy.ipynb) preprocesses the raw data and computes the accuracy scores.
- [1.2.response_accuracy_lmm.ipynb](./1.2.response_accuracy_lmm.ipynb) reproduces Section 4.1.1 of the paper.
- [2.response_accuracy_vis.ipynb](./2.response_accuracy_vis.ipynb) reproduces Figure 3 and 4 of the paper.
- [3.ddm_anova.ipynb](./3.ddm_anova.ipynb) reproduces Section 4.1.3 and Table 1 of the paper.
- [4.ddm_feature_vis.ipynb](./4.ddm_feature_vis.ipynb) reproduces Figure 5 of the paper.
- [5.ddm_tiktok_vis.ipynb](./5.ddm_tiktok_vis.ipynb) reproduces Figure 6 of the paper.
- [6.questionnaire_bayes_factor.ipynb](./6.questionnaire_bayes_factor.ipynb) reproduces Section 4.2 of the paper.
- [appendix1_reaction_time_model_selection_glmm.ipynb](./appendix1_reaction_time_model_selection_glmm.ipynb) additionally explores the reaction time data using a GLMM model.
- [appendix2_ddm_fitting.ipynb](./appendix2_ddm_fitting.ipynb) fits the DDM model to the reaction time data and produces the learned DDM features as [data/ddm.csv](./data/ddm.csv).
